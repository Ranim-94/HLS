This report will talk about high level synthesis (HLS) desing using FPGA. 

Unlike traditional hardware descirption language (VHDL, Verilog), HLS uses high level languages such as \verb|C| and \verb|C++| to design product using FPGA. The advanatage is the speed of learning compared to traditional language.\\
